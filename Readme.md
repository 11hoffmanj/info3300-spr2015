## INFO/CS 3300
## Data-driven web applications / Visual data analytics for the web

This package contains notes and in-class exercises for a Spring 2015 class at Cornell on machine learning in a web context, with d3.

At the end of each class I'm going to post a "prompt" for the next class. This one will be highlighted at the end of our first class, and will form the basis for our discussion on Friday. As we build up complexity during the semester, these will start to look more like templates for interesting mini-projects.
